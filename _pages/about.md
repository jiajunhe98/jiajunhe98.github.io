## Jiajun He (何佳峻)
Research assistant and incoming PhD, University of Cambridge. [CV](https://jiajunhe98.github.io/assets/pdf/New_JiajunHe_CV_academic.pdf)
<br/><br/>

Hi there! I am Jiajun. Currently I am a research assistant in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/).
I will start my PhD here from October 2024.
My research interest revolves around probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian methods and their applications in data generation and compression.


Previously, I completed my MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from University of Cambridge, where I graduated with distinction as the top of my cohort. Prior to that, I obained an MSc in Bioinformatics at [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in Denmark, and a BSc in Biological Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China.
