<!-- ## Jiajun He (何佳峻)
       
<br/><br/> -->
Hello there! I’m Jiajun He (何佳峻)! I am a first-year PhD in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). 
My research interests lie in probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian methods, and their applications in generation and compression.


Previously, I completed my MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from University of Cambridge, where I graduated with distinction as the first of the cohort. For my MPhil dissertation, I worked with [Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/) and [Gergely Flamich](https://gergely-flamich.github.io/) on data compression with Implicit Neural Representations. Prior to that, I obained an MSc in Bioinformatics at [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in Denmark, and a BSc in Biological Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in China.


I am an landscape photographer in my spare time. Feel free to explore my works on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jiajunhe614/). I will do my best to keep it updated!
