[Diffusion Neural Sampler](https://jiajunhe98.github.io/assets/pdf/Diffusion-Neural-Sampler.pdf)\
*MLG Reading Group at University of Cambridge*\
<sub>**Abstract:** Sampling from unnormalized density is a fundamental task in machine learning. Recently, motivated by the success of diffusion models, diffusion-based neural sampler start to gain attention. In this talk, we will look at several recently developed diffusion-based neural samplers, and discuss their design choices. We classify diffusion/controlled-based neural samplers according to either their choices of sampling process, or their training objectives. By combining different sampling process with different objectives, we can recover almost all diffusion/controlled-based neural samplers  in recent literatures.</sub>
